                        <p>Hey there, I’m David! I lead over 300 team members and manage assets worth 470 million dollars for a large-scale program worth 2 billion dollars. I focus on implementing process improvements for smoother operations and strive to be an effective leader.</p>
                        <p>I’m passionate about continuous growth and development, so I’m excited to pursue a BS in Internet and Web Development at Arizona State University! I’ve loved graphic design and web development since I was fifteen, but unfortunately, serving in the military kept me from pursuing those passions. After attending ASU for the last few years, I’m finally preparing for my retirement from the Air Force and can’t wait to dive back into what I love most.</p>
                        <p>I’ve learned to stay calm through my time in leadership positions and military service. Once I finish my degree and retire from the military, I’m excited to jump into a career as a web developer at an agency. When I’m not working, I love working on vehicles, going for bike rides, and playing video games. My wonderful wife and I have been married for 20 years and have three incredible sons.</p>
